# Rentry.Co Gradient Tool

This, is a colored text in rentry.co.<br>
"%#FFFF00%Hello World!%%"<br><br>
Rather simple by itself, but what if I want to make a *gradient* of colors?
<br>I'd have to not only calculate the steps between colors but fit it all into a massive janky string that is extremely hard to manually modify or read. (I've learned the hard way...)
<br><br>That's why I made this tool which is as easy as providing an array of hexidecimal color codes & whatever you want to be colored!<br><br>~Rylei C.
